# Rimal

A short narrative-driven 2D platformer where players explore themes of tolerance, coexistence, and cultural heritage in a setting inspired by the United Arab Emirates.

## About the Game

Rimal was developed by Arthur Diniz and Erica de Castro for the 2025 Madar Tolerance Game Jam, organized under the Tolerance Clubs Initiative in the UAE. As you travel through golden dunes and vibrant cities, you’ll collect glowing pearls that reveal messages rooted in the values of unity, respect, and hospitality.

Symbolic obstacles like Scorpions of Misunderstanding stand in your way, but with courage — and a helpful camel or falcon — you’ll overcome them.
